# Artifact for TAPDance

This repository contains the code to reproduce the experiments for the paper: `Architecting Trigger-Action Platforms for Security, Performance and Functionality`. For conducting the experiments, 3 networked machines running Ubuntu 18.04 LTS is required. The paper's results were obtained by running on a [StarFive VisonFive SBC](https://doc-en.rvspace.org/Doc_Center/visionfive.html) and this repository provides an emulation of the same using Qemu.
